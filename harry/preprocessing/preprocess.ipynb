    "1. De oorspronkelijke map `background_dirty` bevat de 229 oorspronkelijke, gedownloade bestanden in verschillende formaten (epub, txt, rtf) etc. De meeste (212) heb ik automatisch naar automatisch naar txt kunnen omzetten (zie map `background`). Voor enkele andere moeten de bestanden nog naar plain text worden omgezet (bestand met .txt-extensie). Dit gebeurt best in een *plain text editor* als `Sublime Text`: opslaan met `File > Save with encoding ... > UTF-8`.\n",
    "2. De front matter and back matter moet nog uit de bestanden verwijderd worden (bv. het deel dat naar de digitalisatie bij Project Gutenberg verwijst). De bedoeling is dat *enkel de auteurstekst zelf* overblijft. Belangrijk is dat alle vermeldingen van de auteurnaam zelf verwijderd worden.\n",
    "3. De metadata is nu opgeslagen als een spreadsheet-bestand dat je zou moeten kunnen inlezen in een applicatie als Microsoft Excel (of uploaden naar Google Drive als er meerdere mensen tegelijk aan zouden werken). Voor elke tekst (die aan de hand van de volledige bestandsnaam wordt geïdentificeerd) moeten we volgende velden hebben:\n",
    "    - bestandnaam in de map `background` (e.g. \"Austen Wuthering Heights.txt\")\n",
    "    - voornaam auteur (e.g. Jane)\n",
    "    - achternaam auteur (e.g. Austen)\n",
    "    - volledige titel van het boek (bv. \"Wuthering Heights\")\n",
    "    - een korte **unieke** versie van de titel (bv. 'heights')\n",
    "    - of het om een 'kostschoolroman' gaat (zie centraal boekenbestand jeugdliteratuur?)\n",
    "    - eerste publicatiedatum van het werk (bv. 1887)\n",
    "    - biologisch gender van de auteur (M/V)\n",
    "Belangrijk is vooral dat de voor- en achternaam van de auteur **consistent** gespeld worden - dit is makkelijk te verifiëren door de spreadsheet op de bewuste kolommen te sorteren, zodat inconsistenties aan het licht komen.\n",
    "4. Er moet geverifieerd worden of er nog belangrijke lacunes zijn die makkelijk kunnen aangevuld worden. Er zijn vooral (1) meer kostschoolromans nodig en (2) er kunnen ook gaten in bepaalde series opgevuld worden. (3) Van sommige belangrijke auteurs kan het zijn dat we nog relatief weinig teksten hebben opegenomen."
